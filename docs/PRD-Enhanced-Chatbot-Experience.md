# Product Requirements Document: Enhanced Conversational AI Chatbot

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the transformation of ChefsCart's current step-by-step chat wizard into a natural, conversational AI experience that supports free-form text input, voice interactions, and intelligent data extraction while maintaining the efficiency of guided selections where appropriate.

## 1. Problem Statement

### Current State Issues
- **Rigid Flow**: Users are forced through a predefined 10-step wizard with limited flexibility
- **Form-like Experience**: Each step feels like filling out a form field rather than having a conversation
- **No Voice Support**: Users must type all responses, limiting accessibility and convenience
- **Limited Context Understanding**: Cannot process complex, multi-faceted responses in a single input
- **No Progress Visibility**: Users can't see what information has been collected at a glance

### User Pain Points
1. "I want to tell the chatbot everything at once, not answer 10 separate questions"
2. "I'd prefer to speak my preferences while cooking or multitasking"
3. "The current flow feels robotic and impersonal"
4. "I can't go back and change something without starting over"
5. "I don't know how much more information I need to provide"

## 2. User Personas
