### Example Conversation Flow
```
AI: Hi! I'm Chef, your personal meal planning assistant. I'd love to help you create the perfect weekly meal plan. Tell me, what brings you here today?

User: I'm tired of cooking the same things every week and want to eat healthier

AI: I totally understand that feeling! Variety is the spice of life, right? Let's shake things up for you. First, what meals are you typically responsible for during the week? Are you cooking breakfast, lunch, dinner, or maybe all three?

User: Mostly dinner, sometimes lunch on weekends

AI: Perfect! So dinner is your main focus with some weekend lunches. How many people are you usually cooking for?

User: Just me and my partner

AI: Got it - meals for two! Now, do either of you have any dietary restrictions I should know about? Things like vegetarian, gluten-free, keto, or anything else?

User: My partner is vegetarian and I'm trying to eat less meat anyway

AI: Excellent! I love creating delicious vegetarian meals. Are there any foods either of you absolutely can't or won't eat? Any allergies or strong dislikes?

[Conversation continues naturally...]
