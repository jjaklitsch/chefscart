# ChefsCart Shop Setup Guide

This guide walks you through completing the affiliate shop implementation.

## üõ† Database Setup

### 1. Create Shop Tables
Run these SQL scripts in your Supabase Dashboard (https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/bcbpcuzjkuptyxinjchg/sql):

```sql
-- First, run the table creation script:
-- Copy and paste contents from: scripts/create-shop-tables.sql

-- Then, populate with initial data:
-- Copy and paste contents from: scripts/populate-shop-data.sql
```

### 2. Verify Table Creation
After running the scripts, verify these tables exist:
- `shop_categories` (9 categories)
- `cooking_equipment` (100+ items) 
- `equipment_categories` (junction table)

## üîë Amazon API Configuration

### 1. Get Amazon Product Advertising API Access
1. Sign up for Amazon Associates Program: https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/
2. Apply for Product Advertising API access: https://webservices.amazon.com/paapi5/
3. Get your AWS Access Key and Secret Key from AWS IAM

### 2. Update Environment Variables
Update these values in `.env.local`:
```env
# Replace with your actual AWS credentials
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=your_actual_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_KEY=your_actual_aws_secret_key

# Verify your affiliate ID
AMAZON_AFFILIATE_ID=chefscart-20
```

**Note**: AWS credentials require IAM user with Product Advertising API permissions.

## üöÄ Testing the Shop

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
cd apps/web && npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Shop Features

#### Shop Home Page
- Navigate to: http://localhost:3001/shop
- Verify: Categories load, search bar works
- Check: Featured equipment displays

#### Category Pages  
- Click on any category (e.g., "Knives & Cutting Tools")
- Verify: Equipment items load with Amazon products
- Test: "View All Options" links work

#### Search Functionality
- Use search bar with terms like "chef knife", "mixing bowl"
- Verify: Amazon products load with affiliate links
- Test: Pagination (Load More button)
- Check: "Add to Amazon Cart" links include affiliate ID

#### Recipe Integration
- Visit any recipe page (e.g., http://localhost:3001/recipes/beef-stir-fry)
- Verify: "Required Equipment" section appears
- Check: Equipment tags link to shop search pages
- Test: Equipment recommendations based on recipe type

### 3. Test Amazon Integration

#### Affiliate Links
All Amazon links should include `tag=chefscart-20`:
- Product page links: `https://www.amazon.com/dp/ASIN?tag=chefscart-20`
- Add to cart links: `https://www.amazon.com/dp/ASIN?tag=chefscart-20&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1`

#### API Rate Limits
- Amazon PA-API has strict rate limits
- Test gradually to avoid hitting limits
- Monitor API response for error messages

## üéØ Key URLs to Test

### Static Pages
- `/shop` - Main shop page
- `/shop/search?q=knife` - Search results

### Dynamic Category Pages
- `/shop/category/knives-cutting-tools`
- `/shop/category/cookware-pans`
- `/shop/category/baking-essentials`
- `/shop/category/kitchen-appliances`

### Recipe Integration
- Visit any recipe and check for equipment sections
