  "description": "Saba Shioyaki is a classic Japanese preparation of mackerel simply seasoned with salt and grilled until the skin is crisp and flesh is tender and oily. Bright lemon or grated daikon often accompanies the fish to cut through the richness, highlighting clean umami and smoky char from grilling.",
